# Project Vegan meal planner

This project was made using React.js, Redux-toolkit, Tailwind.css. I used spoonacular for API.

This application can be used to find relevant vegan recipes based on your daily or weekly caloric intake. If you don't know the amount of calories that you should be consuming daily - there is a BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) calculator that can handle that for you.

The BMR Calculator requires you to input 4 sets of information:

1. Your sex.
2. Your current weight.
3. Your height.
4. Your age.

When you click on 'Calculate' - the calculator takes these four inputs and applies the BMR formula to return the recommended daily caloric amount.

When you click on 'Take your plan' - You must input the daily calory amount and choose if you'd like to receive a daily or a weekly meal plan.

Once you've done that - click on 'Get your plan'.
You should see your meal recommendations, as well as the amount of macro-nutrients (protein/carbohydrates/fat) that they provide. Under each meal you can see how many servings the particular recipe can provide, as well as the preparation time to complete them.

To see the recipe for any of the meals - click on 'Go to recipe' which will link you to the original site that provided it.
